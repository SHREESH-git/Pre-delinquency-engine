C:\Python314\Lib\pickle.py:1835: UserWarning: [19:09:54] WARNING: C:\actions-runner\_work\xgboost\xgboost\src\gbm\../common/error_msg.h:83: If you are loading a serialized model (like pickle in Python, RDS in R) or
configuration generated by an older version of XGBoost, please export the model by calling
`Booster.save_model` from that version first, then load it back in current version. See:

    https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/saving_model.html

for more details about differences between saving model and serializing.
