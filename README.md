# EarlyShield - Pre-delinquency-Risk-Engine

> **Early warning system to detect customer financial stress weeks before default.**

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Economic uncertainty is increasing financial stress, leading to higher delinquency risk for banks. Most institutions react **after payment failure**, when recovery is costly and less effective.

However, early warning signals exist but remain hidden in fragmented systems.

**EarlyShield** is an end-to-end pre-delinquency risk analytics framework that detects emerging customer distress early and enables proactive intervention.

Traditional banking interventions are often "too little, too late," occurring only **after a payment is missed**. 

### Key Challenges:
* **High Recovery Costs:** Typically 15–20% of the recovered amount.
* **Damaged Relationships:** Collection calls stress the customer-bank bond.
* **Missed Signals:** Subtle behavioral changes often go unnoticed by legacy systems.

**Our Goal:** Detect indicators like salary delays, rising credit utilization, and balance deterioration to **predict default risk 2–4 weeks in advance.**

---
## 🎯 Proposed Solution
-  Customer-level credit monitoring  
-  Calibrated Probability of Default (PD)  
-  Loss Given Default (LGD) estimation  
-  Exposure at Default (EAD) quantification  
-  Real-time and batch risk scoring  
-  Behavioral trend modeling  
-  Proactive intervention support

### Machine Learning Value 
* 🔍 **Early Stress Detection:**
* 📈 **Next Month PD Prediction:**
* 💰 **Expected Loss = PD × LGD × EAD**
* 🧊 **Cold-Start Customer Handling:**
* 📊 **SHAP Explainability**
* ⚡ **FastAPI Real-time Scoring:**

## 🧠 Model Architecture



### Hybrid Intelligence
We use a two-pronged approach:

1.  **Tree Ensemble (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost):** Captures complex, nonlinear relationships in tabular transaction data.
2.  **LSTM Sequence Model (PyTorch):** Analyzes chronological behavior to detect "downward spirals" over time.
3.  **Weighted Hybrid Blend:** An ensemble layer that calibrates outputs from both models for bank-grade reliability.
